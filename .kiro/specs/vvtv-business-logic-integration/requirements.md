# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration of the Business Logic Integration blueprint into the comprehensive VVTV Industrial Dossier. The goal is to create a unified technical document that seamlessly combines the high-level industrial system architecture with the detailed Rust implementation and LLM integration patterns.

## Glossary

- **VVTV**: VoulezVous.TV autonomous streaming system
- **Business Logic Integration**: The hybrid architecture connecting YAML configuration to Rust engine
- **Industrial Dossier**: The comprehensive 9-block technical architecture document
- **Cartão Perfurado do Dono**: The YAML-based business configuration system
- **LLM Curador**: The AI-powered content curation assistant
- **Rust Engine**: The deterministic core processing system
- **Autopilot**: The autonomous system adjustment mechanism

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a unified technical document that combines industrial architecture with implementation details, so that I can understand both the high-level system design and the specific code integration patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the integrated document, THE System SHALL present business logic integration within the appropriate industrial blocks
2. WHILE maintaining document structure, THE System SHALL preserve all original industrial dossier content
3. THE System SHALL integrate business logic content into Bloco VII (Monetization & Analytics) seamlessly
4. WHERE technical implementation details exist, THE System SHALL cross-reference with industrial architecture concepts
5. THE System SHALL maintain consistent terminology and formatting throughout the integrated document

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear mapping between YAML configuration and Rust implementation, so that I can understand how business rules translate to executable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL document the complete mapping between Blueprint YAML concepts and Rust implementations
2. WHEN describing implementation phases, THE System SHALL specify exact file locations and function names
3. THE System SHALL include code examples for key integration points
4. THE System SHALL document the LLM integration architecture with circuit breakers and token buckets
5. THE System SHALL specify CLI commands for business logic operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want comprehensive integration procedures, so that I can deploy and maintain the business logic integration system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide step-by-step integration procedures for each implementation phase
2. THE System SHALL document configuration file formats and validation rules
3. THE System SHALL specify monitoring and observability requirements for the integrated system
4. THE System SHALL include troubleshooting procedures for business logic failures
5. THE System SHALL document backup and recovery procedures for business logic configurations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want clear documentation of adaptive programming capabilities, so that I can understand how the system learns and evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL document the Curator Vigilante system with confidence thresholds and token bucket mechanics
2. THE System SHALL explain the Gumbel-Top-k selection algorithm and its business impact
3. THE System SHALL document the autopilot feedback loop and D+1 adjustment mechanisms
4. THE System SHALL specify KPIs and metrics for business logic performance
5. THE System SHALL document the incident learning and auto-merge capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want documented audit trails and governance procedures, so that I can ensure the system meets regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL document all logging and audit trail mechanisms for business logic decisions
2. THE System SHALL specify data retention policies for business logic operations
3. THE System SHALL document access controls and permission systems for configuration changes
4. THE System SHALL include compliance procedures for automated decision-making systems
5. THE System SHALL specify rollback and emergency procedures for business logic failures
